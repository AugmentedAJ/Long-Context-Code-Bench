{task_instructions}

**Ground Truth Diff (Expected Changes):**
```diff
{ground_truth_diff}
```

**Agent's Diff (Actual Changes):**
```diff
{agent_diff}
```

**Evaluation Criteria:**

Evaluate the agent's diff against the ground truth on the following 5 metrics. Each score must be between -1.0 and 1.0:

1. **Correctness** (-1.0 to 1.0): Does the agent's change implement the intended behavior correctly?
   - 1.0: Perfectly correct, matches ground truth semantics
   - 0.0: Partially correct or neutral
   - -1.0: Incorrect or breaks functionality

2. **Completeness** (-1.0 to 1.0): Does the agent achieve all requested changes?
   - 1.0: All changes from ground truth are present
   - 0.0: Some changes present, some missing
   - -1.0: Most or all changes missing

3. **Code Reuse** (-1.0 to 1.0): Does the agent leverage existing code appropriately?
   - 1.0: Excellent reuse, minimal duplication
   - 0.0: Neutral, some duplication
   - -1.0: Excessive duplication or unnecessary code

4. **Best Practices** (-1.0 to 1.0): Does the code follow style, structure, and idiomatic patterns?
   - 1.0: Excellent style and practices
   - 0.0: Acceptable or neutral
   - -1.0: Poor style, anti-patterns

5. **Unsolicited Documentation** (-1.0 to 1.0): Penalizes documentation added when not requested.
   - 1.0: No unsolicited documentation
   - 0.0: Minor documentation additions
   - -1.0: Significant unsolicited documentation (README, CHANGELOG, etc.)

**Output Format:**

Respond with ONLY a valid JSON object in this exact format (no markdown, no code blocks, no additional text):

{{
  "correctness": <float between -1.0 and 1.0>,
  "completeness": <float between -1.0 and 1.0>,
