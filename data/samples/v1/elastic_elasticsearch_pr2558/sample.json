  "task_instructions": "I need to make the ShardsAllocator configurable through node settings instead of being hardcoded. Currently it seems like BalancedShardsAllocator is always used by default, but I want users to be able to choose between different allocators like the EvenShardsCountAllocator through configuration. Can you add support for configuring the allocator type via a setting like 'cluster.routing.allocation.type' with short keys for the built-in allocators and also support for loading custom third-party allocators by their fully qualified class names?",
