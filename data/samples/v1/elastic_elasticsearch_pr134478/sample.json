  "synthesized_task_instructions": "The PAGE_MEM_OVERHEAD_PER_BLOCK constant in Block.java needs to be increased from RamUsageEstimator.NUM_BYTES_OBJECT_ALIGNMENT to RamUsageEstimator.NUM_BYTES_OBJECT_ALIGNMENT * 4. We're seeing issues with circuit breaking not triggering properly when there are many small pages, and experiments show that the current overhead estimate is too low. This should help prevent OOM situations by making the memory accounting more accurate for scenarios with lots of small blocks.",
