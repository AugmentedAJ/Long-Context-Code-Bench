Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nAdding chunking settings to IbmWatsonxService\n\nIssue - https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/117188\r\n\r\n## Description\r\nThis change introduces:\r\n- Chunking settings as a new setting to provide when creating embedding inference endpoints for the IbmWatsonxService\r\n\r\nNote: Chunking currently only runs when large documents are ingested to an index with an inference field.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Ran unit tests and ensured that all succeed\r\n- Tested the following cases with each service with the feature flag enabled:\r\n  - Creating an embedding endpoint with no `chunking_settings` provided generates a model with default chunking settings (keeps existing sentence based chunking strategy with default configurations).\r\n  - Creating an embedding endpoint with `chunking_settings` for a word based chunking strategy provided generates a model that uses the word based chunking strategy.\r\n  - Creating an embedding endpoint with `chunking_settings` for a sentence based chunking strategy provided generates a model that uses the sentence based chunking strategy.\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
