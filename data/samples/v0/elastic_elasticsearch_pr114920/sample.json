Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nSplit out FailedToCommitClusterStateException from watched file error reporting for file-based settings\n\n`processSettingsAndNotifyListeners` is something of a blunt instrument when it comes to error handling: `processFileChanges` is [required to throw](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/f6a1e36d6be56a5d480765ad2d5f72f4adcaef5b/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/file/AbstractFileWatchingService.java#L73) `ExecutionException` \"_if there is an issue while applying the changes from the file_\", and in response, `processSettingsAndNotifyListeners` [logs an \"Error processing watched file\"](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/f6a1e36d6be56a5d480765ad2d5f72f4adcaef5b/server/src/main/java/org/elasticsearch/common/file/AbstractFileWatchingService.java#L300) error and continues.\r\n\r\nIn ES-9360 we've found that this one catch-all error message is not specific enough to determine the appropriate alert severity, and so we'd like a way to opt out of the catch-all error message. @thecoop and I discussed some options, and this was the simplest, so I thought I'd start with that. It peels of a subclass of `ExecutionException` to represent the case that we want to opt out of the error reporting.\r\n\r\nThis PR is something of a \"request for comments\": it's a minimal change that achieves the opting out, but I find it hard to tell whether the resulting method contracts are coherent and understandable.\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
