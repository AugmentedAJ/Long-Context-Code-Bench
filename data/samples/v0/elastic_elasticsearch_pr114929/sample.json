Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nDon't normalize coordinates in GeoTileUtils\n\nThe main users of this class use as input latitudes and longitudes read from doc values. These coordinates are always on bounds so there is no point to try to normalise them, more over when this piece of code is in the hot path for aggregations.\r\n\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
