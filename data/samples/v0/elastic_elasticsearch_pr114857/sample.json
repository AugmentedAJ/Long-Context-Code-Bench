  "task_instructions": "You are working on a codebase. Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nAdjust index creation for dense vector telemetry tests\n\nIn 8.x we need to have bwc back to when before `element_type: byte` existed. To prevent loss of coverage for past versions & telemetry, here I move the index creation around so that we only create with `byte` when we have the more recent telemetry changes (and thus also `byte` elements).\r\n\r\ncloses: https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/114556\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
