Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nReduce scope of `AmazonS3Reference`\n\nIt's possible that the client config, particularly its credentials,\r\nmight change in the middle of a long-running operation such as a large\r\nmultipart upload. Prior to this commit we would hold onto the same\r\n`AmazonS3` instance for the entire operation, but really there's no need\r\nto do so, we can obtain a potentially-fresher instance for each API\r\ncall.\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
