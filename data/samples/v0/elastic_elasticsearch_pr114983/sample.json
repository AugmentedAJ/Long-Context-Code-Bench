  "task_instructions": "You are working on a codebase. Your task is to make the necessary code changes to accomplish the following:\n\nAdd prefilters only once in the compound and text similarity retrievers\n\nThis change ensures that the pre filters are propagated in the downstream retrievers only once. It also removes the ability to extends `explainQuery` in the compound retriever. This is not needed as the rank docs are now responsible for the explanation.\n\nPlease make all necessary code changes to complete this task.",
