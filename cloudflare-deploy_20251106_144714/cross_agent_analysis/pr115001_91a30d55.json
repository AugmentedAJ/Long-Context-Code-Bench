This is a significant difference because the ground truth uses an AsciiDoc attribute that would automatically resolve to the current documentation version, making the documentation maintainable across versions. The agent's approach requires manual updates for each version, which violates documentation best practices for version-aware content.

The key difference between them is that auggie:sonnet4.5 used backticks around '9.0.0' while factory:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 did not. In stark contrast, claude-code:claude-sonnet-4-5 took a fundamentally different approach by updating both the Elastic stack version to 9.0.x and the extraction service version to 0.4.x, which contradicts the ground truth requirement to keep the extraction service at 0.3.x.",
