However, it missed substantial content updates including: (1) updating retriever.asciidoc restrictions section and removing multiple 'Restrictions' subsections, (2) updating rrf.asciidoc with new supported/unsupported features and PIT warning, (3) completely rewriting the retrievers-overview.asciidoc example section with a complex multi-retriever example, (4) updating the GA version text in retrievers-overview.asciidoc, and (5) adding validation logic in CompoundRetrieverBuilder.java.

    "summary": "All three agents (auggie:sonnet4.5, claude-code:claude-sonnet-4-5, and factory:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929) successfully removed the tech-preview headers from the three main documentation files. However, auggie:sonnet4.5 was the only agent to make an additional change by removing a preview tag from the search.asciidoc file, while claude-code:claude-sonnet-4-5 made an extra change to semantic-reranking.asciidoc. None of the agents implemented the substantial documentation updates present in the ground truth diff.",

    "best_agent_reasoning": "auggie:sonnet4.5 achieved the highest aggregate score (0.70) by making one additional relevant change beyond the three core preview header removals. While it still missed the majority of the ground truth changes, it demonstrated slightly better understanding of the task scope by identifying and removing another preview tag in search.asciidoc, which aligns with the overall goal of removing tech-preview markers from retriever-related documentation.",
    "approach_differences": "auggie:sonnet4.5 took a broader interpretation by removing preview tags from four files including search.asciidoc. claude-code:claude-sonnet-4-5 also made four changes but included semantic-reranking.asciidoc instead of search.asciidoc. factory:claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 took the most conservative approach, only removing the three most obvious preview headers from retriever.asciidoc, rrf.asciidoc, and retrievers-overview.asciidoc. All three agents completely missed the extensive documentation content updates, restrictions removals, and feature support list modifications that comprised the majority of the ground truth changes.",
