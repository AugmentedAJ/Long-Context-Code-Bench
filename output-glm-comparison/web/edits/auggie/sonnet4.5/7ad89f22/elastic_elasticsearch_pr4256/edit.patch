 In order to run elasticsearch as a service on your operating system, the provided packages try to make it as easy as possible for you to start and stop elasticsearch during reboot and upgrades.
 
+NOTE: Elasticsearch does not start automatically after installation. You need to start it manually using the commands described below.

 === Linux
 
 Currently our build automatically creates a debian package and an RPM package, which is available on the download page. The package itself does not have any dependencies, but you have to make sure that you installed a JDK.
@@ -26,6 +28,52 @@ Each package features a configuration file, which allows you to set the followin
 `ES_JAVA_OPTS`::          Any additional java options you may want to apply. This may be useful, if you need to set the `node.name` property, but do not want to change the `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file, because it is distributed via a provisioning system like puppet or chef. Example: `ES_JAVA_OPTS="-Des.node.name=search-01"`
 `RESTART_ON_UPGRADE`::    Configure restart on package upgrade, defaults to `false`. This means you will have to restart your elasticsearch instance after installing a package manually. The reason for this is to ensure, that upgrades in a cluster do not result in a continouos shard reallocation resulting in high network traffic and reducing the response times of your cluster.
 
+==== Starting Elasticsearch Manually
+
+After installation, Elasticsearch will not start automatically. You need to start it manually using one of the following commands:
+
+For systems using systemd (newer distributions):
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+For systems using init.d or service command:
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+sudo service elasticsearch start
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+To enable Elasticsearch to start automatically on system boot:
+
+For systemd:
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+sudo systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+For init.d (already enabled during installation):
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+# Already configured via update-rc.d or chkconfig during installation
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+To check the status of Elasticsearch:
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+sudo service elasticsearch status
+# or
+sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service
+--------------------------------------------------
+
+To stop Elasticsearch:
+[source,sh]
+--------------------------------------------------
+sudo service elasticsearch stop
+# or
+sudo systemctl stop elasticsearch.service
+--------------------------------------------------
+
 ==== Debian/Ubuntu
 
 The debian package ships with everything you need as it uses standard debian tools like update `update-rc.d` to define the runlevels it runs on. The init script is placed at `/etc/init.d/elasticsearch` is you would expect it. The configuration file is placed at `/etc/default/elasticsearch`.
