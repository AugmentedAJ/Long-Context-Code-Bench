 == Running as a Service on Windows
 
-Windows users can configure Elasticsearch to run as a service to run in the background or start automatically 
-at startup without any user interaction.
+Windows users can configure Elasticsearch to run as a service to run in the background without any user interaction.
 This can be achieved through `service.bat` script under `bin/` folder which allows one to install,
 remove, manage or configure the service and potentially start and stop the service, all from the command-line.
 
+[NOTE]
+====
+After installing the Elasticsearch service, it is NOT started automatically. You need to start it manually using:
+
+* To start the service: `service.bat start` (or `sc start elasticsearch-service-x64` for the 64-bit service)
+* To stop the service: `service.bat stop` (or `sc stop elasticsearch-service-x64` for the 64-bit service)
+
+To configure the service to start automatically on Windows startup, use:
+* Via service manager: `service.bat manager` and set the startup type to "Automatic"
+* Via command line: `sc config elasticsearch-service-x64 start= auto`
