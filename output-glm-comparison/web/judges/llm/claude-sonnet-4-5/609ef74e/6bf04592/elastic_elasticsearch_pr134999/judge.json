  "rationale": "The agent's diff is functionally identical to the ground truth. Both diffs change the `overall_score` parameter from a string value \"41.0\" to a numeric value 41.0 in exactly two locations (lines 605 and 627) within the same YAML test file. The changes correctly fix the parameter type from string to number as requested by the task instructions. There are no differences in the actual modifications between the agent's output and the ground truth - both remove the quotes around 41.0 in the same locations. No unsolicited documentation or extra files were added. The agent achieved exactly what was requested with no deviations.",
