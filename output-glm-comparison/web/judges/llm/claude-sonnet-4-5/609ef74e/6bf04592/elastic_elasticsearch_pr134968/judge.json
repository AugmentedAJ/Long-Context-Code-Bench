  "rationale": "The agent made zero changes to the codebase (empty diff), while the ground truth modifies `.buildkite/scripts/update-transport-versions.sh` to change the git diff check from `--exit-code` to `--quiet -- \"server/src/main/resources/transport/**\"` and updates the echo message. This represents a complete failure to implement the requested task. The agent did not modify the CI script to ignore non-transport changes when auto-committing, which was the core requirement. Since no code was changed, code_reuse, best_practices, and unsolicited_docs are scored neutrally at 0.0 (no code to evaluate). Correctness and completeness are both -1.0 due to total absence of required changes.",
