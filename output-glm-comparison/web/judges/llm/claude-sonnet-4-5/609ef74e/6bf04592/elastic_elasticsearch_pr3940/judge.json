  "rationale": "The agent modified the wrong section of the documentation. The task was to 'fix the confusing wording in the cluster health timeout documentation,' and the ground truth clarified the example paragraph (lines 38-43) that explains how the timeout works when waiting for cluster status. The agent instead modified the parameter reference section (lines 75-78), changing 'wait_for_XXX' to explicitly list parameter names. While this is a minor improvement to that section, it completely misses the actual confusing wording identified in the ground truth. The agent's change addresses a different clarity issue in a different part of the document, failing to implement the requested fix.",
