  "rationale": "The agent made a critical error in scope interpretation. The task explicitly requested changing 'snapshot_only' to 'snapshotOnly' in JSON for SET docs to fix inconsistent naming conventions. The ground truth shows only 2 files needed changes: project_routing.json (1 occurrence) and DocsV3Support.java (2 occurrences generating the JSON). The agent instead changed 'snapshot_only' to 'snapshotOnly' in hundreds of function/operator JSON files that were not mentioned in the task and appear to be generated outputs, not source files. The agent missed the critical Java source file (DocsV3Support.java) that actually generates these JSONs, meaning the inconsistency would persist on regeneration. Additionally, the agent changed only 1 of 2 occurrences in the Java file (line 1412 was changed but line 1109 was missed in the agent's diff). This demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the task scope and the codebase architecture. Correctness is severely impacted because the actual source of the problem (Java generator) was not fully fixed, and completeness is poor because the agent worked on wrong files while missing the essential source file changes.",
