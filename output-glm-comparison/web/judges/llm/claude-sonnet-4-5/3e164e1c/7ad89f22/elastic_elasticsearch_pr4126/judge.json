  "rationale": "The agent added the maven-jar-plugin with test-jar goal, which is the core requirement, but has critical deficiencies: (1) Missing the <configuration><includes> section that filters test classes to only 'org/elasticsearch/test/**/*', meaning it would package ALL test classes instead of just the framework classes intended for external use. (2) Placed the plugin at line 423 instead of the ground truth location around line 975, though placement alone isn't a functional issue. (3) Used version 2.4 instead of 2.3.2, which is a minor difference but deviates from ground truth without clear justification. The missing includes configuration is a major completeness issue that could expose internal test utilities not meant for external consumption, partially defeating the purpose of selective packaging.",
