The only difference is in the diff metadata (commit hash shortened in agent's version), which is cosmetic and doesn't affect the actual code change. The agent correctly identified and fixed the requested typo with no extraneous changes, matching the ground truth exactly in terms of correctness, completeness, and best practices. No code reuse considerations apply to a simple typo fix, and no unsolicited documentation was added.",
