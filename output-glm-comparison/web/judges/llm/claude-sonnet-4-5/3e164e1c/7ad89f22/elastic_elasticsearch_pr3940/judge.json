  "rationale": "The agent fixed a different section of the documentation than what was intended. The ground truth addresses confusing wording in lines 40-43 about waiting until the cluster reaches a certain health level, clarifying the timeout semantics with better word ordering ('wait for 50 seconds for the cluster to reach' vs 'wait till the cluster reaches... for 50 seconds') and explaining that it returns early if the status is reached before timeout. The agent instead modified lines 76-77 in the `timeout` parameter description, making a minor grammatical fix ('wait_for_XXX are provided' to 'wait_for_XXX parameters are provided'). While the agent's change is technically correct and does improve clarity slightly, it completely misses the main confusing wording that the task was asking to fix. The task instruction 'fix the confusing wording in the cluster health timeout documentation' is ambiguous but the ground truth clearly shows the intended target was the example paragraph, not the parameter description. This represents a major completeness failure.",
