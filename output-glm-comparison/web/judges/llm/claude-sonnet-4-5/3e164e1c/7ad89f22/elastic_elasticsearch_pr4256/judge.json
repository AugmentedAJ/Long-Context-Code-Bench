  "rationale": "The agent's implementation has several critical issues. In postinst, it comments out the startElasticsearch call but leaves the update-rc.d command entirely removed, whereas ground truth keeps the registration mechanism but removes auto-start on fresh install and adds clear echo messages. In postinstall, the agent only comments out startElasticsearch without removing the systemctl enable and daemon-reload calls that ground truth removes, and adds only inline comments instead of the echo statements that guide users. The documentation changes are excessive and unsolicited: the agent adds a large 'Starting Elasticsearch Manually' section with status/stop commands that weren't requested, while ground truth adds minimal, targeted instructions within the existing Debian and RPM sections. Ground truth removes update-rc.d from postinst and restructures the RPM section into subsections with specific commands, while the agent misses these structural changes entirely. The agent's approach violates the 'avoid over-engineering' principle by adding comprehensive documentation when only startup command documentation was requested.",
