  "rationale": "The agent's approach has a critical logic flaw: it uses `git diff --exit-code` on line 34 which exits the script if there are NO changes at all, preventing the subsequent non-transport change detection from ever running. The ground truth correctly uses `--quiet` flag and checks specifically for transport changes with positive pathspec. The agent's negative pathspec approach (':!server/src/main/resources/transport/') is less direct and more error-prone than the ground truth's positive pathspec. However, the agent does add the beneficial change of `git add server/src/main/resources/transport/` instead of `git add -A .`, which is more precise. The additional echo statements are somewhat helpful but add unnecessary verbosity. The logic inversion (checking for non-transport changes vs checking for transport changes) makes the code harder to follow.",
