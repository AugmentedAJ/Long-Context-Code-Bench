  "rationale": "The agent's diff is identical to the ground truth diff. Both change line 86 in ThreadPoolMergeExecutorServiceDiskSpaceTests.java from 'randomIntBetween(2, 9)' to 'randomIntBetween(2, 8)'. This correctly addresses the task instruction to fix the upper bound issue where randomIntBetween is inclusive on both ends but the test expected exclusive upper bound. The change is minimal, targeted, and correct. No extra files, documentation, or unsolicited changes were added. The implementation matches human-level quality exactly.",
