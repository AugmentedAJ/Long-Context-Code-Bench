  "rationale": "The agent correctly exposes the timeout parameter in the REST interface, implementing the core requirement. However, there are two key differences from ground truth: (1) The agent uses `null` as the default value instead of `nodesInfoRequest.timeout()`, which breaks the existing timeout fallback behavior and could cause NPE or unexpected behavior. (2) The agent added timeout handling to 9 additional inner handler classes (RestSettingsHandler, RestOsHandler, etc.) which were not in the ground truth. While this appears more thorough, it deviates from the minimal change approach shown in ground truth. The use of `null` instead of preserving the existing timeout is a moderate correctness issue that could affect runtime behavior. The pattern is consistent across all changes, showing good code consistency, but the default value choice is problematic.",
