  "rationale": "The agent's diff is identical to the ground truth diff. Both change line 86 in ThreadPoolMergeExecutorServiceDiskSpaceTests.java from `randomIntBetween(2, 9)` to `randomIntBetween(2, 8)`, which correctly addresses the task instruction about fixing the inclusive upper bound issue. The file path, line number, and exact change all match. There are no additional changes, no unsolicited documentation, and no deviations from the expected solution. This is a perfect match to human-level performance.",
