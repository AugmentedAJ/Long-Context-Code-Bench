  "rationale": "The agent's changes have a critical correctness issue: in the background (else) branch, it removes 'exec' from the Java command, which changes the process handling behavior significantly from ground truth. Ground truth keeps 'exec' and removes only the pidfile writing, while the agent removes both 'exec' and pidfile writing. This means the Java process becomes a child rather than replacing the shell, which is functionally different. The agent correctly removes duplicate pidfile writing and cleans up the foreground branch's return code handling, but incompletely addresses the background branch - ground truth uses 'return $?' directly after exec, while agent keeps the intermediate 'execval' variable. The agent adds three explanatory comments that were not requested by the task instructions, violating the 'no unsolicited documentation' principle. The comments explain behavior rather than document APIs, but still constitute unrequested additions. Ground truth has one comment explaining why code doesn't execute; agent has three comments explaining various aspects.",
