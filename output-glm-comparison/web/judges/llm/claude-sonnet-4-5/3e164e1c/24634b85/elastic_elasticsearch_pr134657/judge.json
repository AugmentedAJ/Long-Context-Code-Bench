  "rationale": "The agent's diff is identical to the ground truth diff. Both diffs modernize two switch statements in DocIdsWriter.java by replacing the traditional case-break syntax with arrow syntax (->). The first switch statement is in the write method (lines 103-112) and the second is in the read method (lines 261-270). All five case labels plus the default case are converted identically in both diffs. There are no differences in correctness, completeness, code reuse, or best practices - the agent achieved exactly what was requested at human level quality. No unsolicited documentation was added, earning full marks on that metric.",
