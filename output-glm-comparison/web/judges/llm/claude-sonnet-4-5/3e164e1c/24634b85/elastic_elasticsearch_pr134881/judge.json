  "rationale": "The agent correctly changed all instances of 'snapshot_only' to 'snapshotOnly' across the codebase, implementing the requested naming convention fix. However, the scope differs significantly from ground truth: the agent modified 232 JSON files in docs/reference/query-languages/esql/kibana/definition/functions/, operators/, and settings/, plus settings/project_routing.json. Ground truth only changed project_routing.json and DocsV3Support.java. The agent's changes are technically correct (all snake_case to camelCase conversions are valid) and more thorough, but the task instruction was ambiguous about scope. The ground truth suggests the issue was localized to SET docs (settings), not all function/operator definitions. The agent also correctly updated the Java file DocsV3Support.java:1112 that generates these JSON files, matching ground truth. No unsolicited documentation was added. The completeness score is higher because the agent fixed the inconsistency everywhere it appeared, which could be viewed as better than the minimal ground truth fix, though it's unclear if this broader scope was intended.",
