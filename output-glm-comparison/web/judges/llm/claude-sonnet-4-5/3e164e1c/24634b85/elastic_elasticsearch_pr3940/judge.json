  "rationale": "The agent's changes address the core confusing wording issue (how the timeout works) but go beyond what was requested. Ground truth made minimal, focused changes to clarify the timeout behavior in the example paragraph (lines 38-43). The agent made the same core fix but also: (1) removed 'high water-mark' terminology (not requested), (2) added explanatory text about immediate return, (3) modified the timeout parameter documentation (lines 77-79) which wasn't part of the task scope. While these extra changes do improve clarity, they constitute unsolicited documentation additions that weren't in the task instructions 'fix the confusing wording in the cluster health timeout documentation' when interpreted against the ground truth scope. The core fix is correct and improves upon ground truth slightly with 'will return immediately' being clearer than 'will return at that point', but the additional scope expansion warrants penalty.",
