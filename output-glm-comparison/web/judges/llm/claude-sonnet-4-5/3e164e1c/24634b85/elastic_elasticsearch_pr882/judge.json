  "rationale": "The agent correctly fixed the typo 'Fist' -> 'First' that was requested in the task instructions, matching the ground truth diff exactly. Additionally, the agent identified and fixed a second typo 'Maan' -> 'Man' on line 122 that was not in the ground truth. This is a beneficial extra correction that improves the document without introducing any issues. The task instruction was simply 'fix readme typo' (singular), but fixing multiple typos in a readme is a reasonable and beneficial interpretation. Since the agent completed the requested change and added a valuable extra fix without any negative impact, this earns positive scores for correctness and completeness.",
