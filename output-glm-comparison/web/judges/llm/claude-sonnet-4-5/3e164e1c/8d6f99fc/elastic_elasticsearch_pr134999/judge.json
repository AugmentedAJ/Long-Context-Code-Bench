  "rationale": "The agent correctly changed the first occurrence of `overall_score: \"41.0\"` to `overall_score: 41.0` on line 605, matching the ground truth. However, the agent failed to apply the same fix to the second occurrence on line 627 in the 'Test Overall buckets given missing job' section. The task instruction was to 'fix the overall_score parameter type in the ML YAML test' (plural scope implied by 'parameter type' fix), and the ground truth shows two instances that needed correction. The agent only completed 50% of the required changes. No unsolicited documentation was added. The change made is correct but incomplete.",
