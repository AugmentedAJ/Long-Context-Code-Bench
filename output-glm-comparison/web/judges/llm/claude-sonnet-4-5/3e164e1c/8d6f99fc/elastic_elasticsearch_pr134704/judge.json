  "rationale": "The agent's implementation is functionally identical to the ground truth. Both add a public getter method `getClusterInfoService()` that returns the `clusterInfoService` field in AllocationService.java. The only difference is placement: the agent placed the getter after line 134 (after `getAllocationDeciders()`), while the ground truth placed it after line 138 (after `getShardRoutingRoleStrategy()`). Both placements are valid and follow Java conventions of grouping getter methods together. The method signature, return type, and implementation are identical. No unsolicited documentation or extra changes were added. This represents human-level quality with a trivial difference in method ordering that has no functional impact.",
