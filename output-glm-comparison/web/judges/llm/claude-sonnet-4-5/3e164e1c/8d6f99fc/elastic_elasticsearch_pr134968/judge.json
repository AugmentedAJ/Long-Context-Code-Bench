  "rationale": "The agent's solution addresses a different part of the problem than the ground truth. The ground truth modifies the conditional check (lines 34-36) to use 'git diff --quiet -- server/src/main/resources/transport/**' to specifically check for transport changes before deciding whether to skip auto-commit. The agent instead modifies the 'git add' command (lines 42-47) to selectively stage only transport-related files. While both approaches attempt to ignore non-transport changes, they differ critically: (1) The ground truth prevents the commit workflow from even starting if no transport changes exist, which is more efficient and cleaner. (2) The agent's approach still proceeds with the commit workflow but only stages transport files, which could result in an empty commit if no transport files changed, potentially causing git commit to fail unless --allow-empty is used. (3) The agent's hardcoded file paths (TransportVersion.java, TransportVersions.java) are brittle and may miss other transport-related files, while the ground truth uses a path pattern that's more maintainable. (4) The agent didn't update the echo message as the ground truth did. The agent's solution is partially functional but less correct, less complete, and uses a less robust approach than the ground truth.",
