  "rationale": "The agent's diff is identical to the ground truth diff. Both move the `shutdown()` call from inside the synchronized block (after line 55) to outside the synchronized block (after the closing brace on line 56). This correctly resolves the deadlock issue by ensuring `shutdown()` is called without holding the monitor lock, preventing the lock ordering problem where the monitor lock and mainLock were acquired in conflicting orders. The change is minimal, targeted, and matches the expected solution exactly. No extra files, documentation, or code were added. All metrics score 0.0 (human level) as the agent perfectly replicated the ground truth.",
