  "rationale": "The agent correctly identifies the constant to modify (PAGE_MEM_OVERHEAD_PER_BLOCK) and increases the memory overhead estimate as requested. However, there are two key differences from ground truth: (1) The multiplier is 3 instead of 4, which may be insufficient for the circuit breaking scenario described in the task, resulting in a correctness penalty. (2) The agent significantly rewrote the comment documentation when the task did not request documentation changes - ground truth adds a brief addendum while agent replaces entire sentences, constituting unsolicited documentation. The core functionality change is complete (increasing the overhead), code reuse is equivalent (both multiply the constant), and both follow similar style patterns for constant multiplication.",
