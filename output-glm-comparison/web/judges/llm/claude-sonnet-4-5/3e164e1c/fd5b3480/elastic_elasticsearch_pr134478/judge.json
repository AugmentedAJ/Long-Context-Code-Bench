  "rationale": "The agent correctly modified the PAGE_MEM_OVERHEAD_PER_BLOCK constant to multiply by 4, which is the core functional change. However, the agent failed to update the JavaDoc comment explaining the rationale for this change. The ground truth added explanatory text ('We uplift it * 4 based on experiments with many small pages.') to document why this multiplier was introduced, which is important for code maintainability and understanding the circuit breaking behavior. The omission of this documentation represents incomplete implementation of the task, as the task title mentions handling 'circuit breaking with many small pages' - context that should be preserved in comments.",
