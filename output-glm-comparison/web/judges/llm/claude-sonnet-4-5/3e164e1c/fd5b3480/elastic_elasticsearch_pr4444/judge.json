  "rationale": "The agent correctly identifies and resolves the deadlock by moving shutdown() outside the synchronized block, matching the core intent of the ground truth. However, the agent's solution is more complex: it introduces a boolean flag 'terminated' to defer the listener.onTerminated() call until after the synchronized block, then explicitly calls super.shutdown() instead of the implicit shutdown(). The ground truth simply moves shutdown() outside the synchronized block with minimal changes. Both solutions are functionally correct and resolve the deadlock, but the agent's approach adds unnecessary complexity (extra variable, conditional logic) where the simpler ground truth solution suffices. The agent does handle the edge case of calling the listener outside the lock more explicitly, which could be seen as slightly more defensive, but this wasn't required by the task. No unsolicited documentation was added. Code reuse is equivalent (both call shutdown appropriately). Best practices are somewhat diminished due to added complexity.",
