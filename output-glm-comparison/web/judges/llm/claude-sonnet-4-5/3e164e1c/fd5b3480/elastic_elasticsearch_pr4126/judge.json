  "rationale": "The agent correctly implemented the maven-jar-plugin with test-jar goal to package test framework classes from org/elasticsearch/test, achieving the core requirement. The configuration is functionally equivalent to ground truth with minor differences: uses version 2.4 vs 2.3.2, adds explicit execution id/phase, and uses classifier 'test-framework' instead of relying on default. These are valid Maven practices and don't impact functionality negatively. However, the agent added significant unsolicited documentation to TESTING.asciidoc (17 lines explaining how third-party plugins can use the test framework), which was not requested in the task instructions. The ground truth shows this was purely a packaging task with no documentation requirements. The plugin configuration placement differs slightly (after compiler plugin vs after release plugin in ground truth) but is acceptable. The include pattern differs slightly (org/elasticsearch/test/** vs org/elasticsearch/test/**/*) but both are functionally equivalent glob patterns.",
