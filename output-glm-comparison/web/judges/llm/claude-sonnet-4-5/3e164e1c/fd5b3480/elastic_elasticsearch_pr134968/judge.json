  "rationale": "The agent's solution correctly addresses the core task: fixing the CI script to ignore non-transport changes when auto-committing. Both the ground truth and agent's solution modify the key git diff check at line 33-34 to focus on the transport directory. The agent goes further by: (1) introducing a TRANSPORT_STATE_PATH variable for DRY principles, (2) applying the same scoping to the pre-check at lines 9-11, (3) scoping the git add command to only stage transport files, and (4) updating git status to show only relevant files. The ground truth uses --quiet flag while the agent uses --exit-code (both achieve the same result). The agent's additional changes (pre-check scoping, scoped git add) are beneficial and more thorough in preventing non-transport files from being committed, though not strictly required by the minimal task description. There's one unnecessary blank line added (line 34), a minor style issue. No unsolicited documentation was added. Overall, the agent's solution is more comprehensive and robust than the ground truth, addressing the spirit of the task more completely.",
