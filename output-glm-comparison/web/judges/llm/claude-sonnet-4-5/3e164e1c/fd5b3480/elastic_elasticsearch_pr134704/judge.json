  "rationale": "The agent's implementation is functionally identical to the ground truth. Both add the same getter method `getClusterInfoService()` that returns the `clusterInfoService` field in the AllocationService class. The only difference is placement: the agent placed it after the `getAllocationDeciders()` method (line 134) while the ground truth placed it after the `getShardRoutingRoleStrategy()` method (line 138). This placement difference is purely stylistic and has no impact on correctness, completeness, or functionality. The method signature, return type, and implementation are identical. No additional files were modified, no unsolicited documentation was added, and the code follows the existing pattern of simple getter methods in the class. The slight placement variation does not constitute better or worse adherence to best practices since Java does not mandate getter ordering and both positions are reasonable.",
