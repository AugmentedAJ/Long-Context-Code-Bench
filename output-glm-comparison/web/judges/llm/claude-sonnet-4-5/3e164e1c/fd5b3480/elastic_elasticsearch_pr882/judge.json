  "rationale": "The agent correctly fixed the typo 'Fist' to 'First' in README.textile:35, matching the ground truth exactly. However, the agent also added an unsolicited change by appending a newline at the end of the file (line 223), which was not requested in the task instructions. This extra modification goes beyond the scope of 'fix readme typo' and represents an unrequested formatting change. While adding a trailing newline is a minor best practice improvement (hence +0.1 for best_practices), it still represents work not asked for. The core typo fix is correct and complete, but the additional change prevents a perfect score.",
