  "rationale": "The agent correctly changed all instances of 'snapshot_only' to 'snapshotOnly' across the codebase. Ground truth shows 2 files changed (project_routing.json and DocsV3Support.java), while the agent changed those same 2 files plus 275+ additional JSON files in docs/reference/query-languages/esql/kibana/definition/functions/ and operators/. Since the task was to 'change snapshot_only to snapshotOnly to make it consistent' and the JSON docs have 'inconsistent naming convention with snake_case and camelCase mixed together', the agent's broader scope is actually MORE correct and complete than the ground truth. The ground truth appears to have missed the majority of files that needed updating. All changes follow the exact same pattern (replacing the field name in JSON), no unsolicited documentation was added, and the approach is consistent with best practices for systematic refactoring.",
