# Contributing to Long-Context-Bench

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Long-Context-Bench! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Long-Context-Code-Bench.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Install development dependencies: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python â‰¥ 3.11
- Git
- GitHub personal access token

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install in development mode
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up environment variables
export GITHUB_GIT_TOKEN=your_token
export AUGMENT_API_TOKEN=your_token  # If testing with Auggie
```

## Code Style

We follow PEP 8 and use automated tools to enforce code style:

- **Black** for code formatting
- **Ruff** for linting
- **MyPy** for type checking

Before submitting a PR, run:

```bash
# Format code
black src/ tests/

# Check linting
ruff check src/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy src/
```

## Testing

We use pytest for testing. Please add tests for any new functionality.

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=long_context_bench --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_utils.py
```

## Adding a New Runner

To add support for a new CLI agent:

1. Create a new file in `src/long_context_bench/runners/` (e.g., `my_agent.py`)
2. Implement a class that inherits from `BaseRunner`
3. Implement the `run()` method
4. Register the runner in `src/long_context_bench/runners/__init__.py`
5. Add tests in `tests/test_runners.py`
6. Update documentation

Example:

```python
from .base import BaseRunner, RunnerResult

class MyAgentRunner(BaseRunner):
    def run(self, workspace_path, task_instructions, logs_path):
        # Implement agent execution
        pass
```

## Submitting Changes

1. Ensure all tests pass: `pytest`
2. Ensure code is formatted: `black src/ tests/`
3. Ensure linting passes: `ruff check src/ tests/`
4. Commit your changes with a descriptive message
5. Push to your fork
6. Create a Pull Request

### Commit Message Guidelines

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit first line to 72 characters
- Reference issues and PRs when relevant

Example:
```
